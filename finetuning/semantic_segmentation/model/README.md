We build upon the code of Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) which can be found at:
- DPT: https://github.com/isl-org/DPT

The repository only provides the baseline model. 
Therefore, we create our own training and other necessary code.

We save the DPT code under: "./finetuning/semantic_segmentation/model/DPT/dpt"

Our code is saved under: "./finetuning/semantic_segmentation/model/src"

The training is run from the main.py script.

All output results will be saved at: ./finetuning/semantic_segmentation/output_dir

It contains all necessary config files.
