# The dataset has 2 level directory structure:
#   -> 1st level: 
#       - Represents Cholec80 videos (CholecSeg8k contains 17 out of 80 Cholec80 videos)
#   -> 2nd level:
#       - Each directory is a video clip of 80 consequtive frames from the corresponding video.
#       - The naming convention is {video_name}_{starting_frame_number}, 
#         e.g. if the name is video01_00080, then this directory 
#         contains frames 80 - 159 from video01 of Cholec80 dataset.
#
#
# NOTE:
#   The dataset contains 13 classes in total, including class 0 - background.
#
#   For each frame, 4 separate .png files are saved.
#   1) raw image (e.g. frame_80_endo.png)
#   2) watershed_mask (e.g. frame_80_endo_watershed_mask.png)
#   3) annotation mask (e.g. frame_80_endo_mask.png)
#       - This mask was used by the annotation tool during the annotation process and can be ignored.
#   4) color mask (e.g. frame_80_endo_color_mask.png)
#       - This mask is equivallent to the watershed mask but color values for each class are different.
#       - In watershed masks each class was assigned 1 color, but Red, Green and Blue values of each of
#         these colors are the same. (e.g. class 0 = color [127, 127, 127]).
#       - On the other hand, in color masks each class was also assigned 1 color, but there is no
#         restriction on RGB values. (e.g. class 3 = color [231,  70, 156])
#       - The color mask is used for visualization purposes.

#
# How do we pre-process the dataset?
#
# 1) Creating our own ground truth masks
# -> For each image we create an additional "ground truth segmentation mask".
# -> Watershed and color masks aren't convenient to use.
# -> Instead, for each image, we create an additional RGB image, where each pixel is represented by it's class value.
#    For example, if our .png image is of shape [3, 224, 224] and pixel [0, 0] belongs to class 5, then
#    [:, 0, 0] = [5, 5, 5], i.e. the pixel's RGB color values are its class repeated 3 times.
# -> We save the image as .png file (e.g. for image "frame_80_endo.png" we create "frame_80_endo_gt_mask.png").
#
# 2) We compare our results to the benchmark introduced here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9871583
# -> Therefore, we pre-process Cholec80 and train our models as close as possible to what they describe in the paper.
# -> Most importantly, they combine several classes that appear rarely in the dataset into one bigger class, as
#    well as combine the only 2 instrument classes into one class.
# -> In the end instead of 13 classes we end up with 8.
# -> We have created dictionaries that map original watershed_mask color values to the new classes in:
#    ./utils/CholecSeg8k_color_dict.py (original 13 class mapping) and
#    ./utils/CholecSeg8k_color_dict_combined_classes.py (mapping after combining classes).
#
# 3) Incorrect color values:
# -> While pre-processing the dataset we observed 2 errors:
#    a) In the original dataset there should be 13 classes in total, which are represented by their own unique color
#       in watershed and color masks. However, we have observed that some pixels have another 14th color. These pixels are
#       colored black in watershed masks and white in color masks.
#       
#       SOLUTION: You will notice in the mapping dictionaries that we included another 14th class, however when calculating
#                 the loss and metric values during training we use the "ignore_index" option to ignore these pixels.
#
#    b) Watershed and color masks of 4 images, namely:
#           "./datasets/CholecSeg8k/data/video18/video18_01139/frame_1216_endo.png",
#           "./datasets/CholecSeg8k/data/video35/video35_00780/frame_858_endo.png",
#           "./datasets/CholecSeg8k/data/video37/video37_00848/frame_865_endo.png",
#           "./datasets/CholecSeg8k/data/video37/video37_00848/frame_926_endo.png",
#
#       were color corrected by the authors. However, afterwards they were saved in RGBA instead of
#       RGB format like the rest of the dataset, we correct that in the pre-processing. We save the
#       paths of the incorrectly saved images at:
#
#       "./datasets/CholecSeg8k/data_preprocessed/incorrectly_saved_images.txt"
#
